# gpmpc
gaussian process model predictive control in MATLAB

===========================================================

BECAUSE,

This code is developed for the personal use initially

My coding style is no-style

Code is very hard to understand because no comments

I am so busy making my living

SO,

IF YOU THINK THIS CODE IS USEFUL AND YOU WANT USE IT, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK WHEN YOU HAVE A QUESTION

ANY COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE VERYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WELCOME.

===========================================================

Install PILCO before using this code (I use PILCO to calculate GP predictions and partial derivatives)
